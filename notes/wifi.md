Sure, you can create a similar function in Zsh to connect to a Wi-Fi network. Here’s how you can define the function in your `.zshrc` file:

1. Open your `.zshrc` file in an editor:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. Add the following function definition to the file:

   ```zsh
   # Function to connect to Wi-Fi
   swifi() {
       local SSID=$1
       local PASSWORD=$2

       # Check if SSID and PASSWORD are provided
       if [ -z "$SSID" ] || [ -z "$PASSWORD" ]; then
           echo "Usage: swifi <SSID> <PASSWORD>"
           return 1
       fi

       # Connect to the specified Wi-Fi network
       nmcli device wifi connect "$SSID" password "$PASSWORD"

       # Check the connection status
       if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
           echo "Connected to $SSID successfully."
       else
           echo "Failed to connect to $SSID."
       fi
   }
   ```

3. Save and close the file (in nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, and then `Enter`).

4. Reload your `.zshrc` file to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

Now, you can use the `swifi` function in your Zsh shell to connect to a Wi-Fi network. Here’s an example of how to use it:

```bash
swifi ppppp 12345
```

This will attempt to connect to the Wi-Fi network with the SSID `ppppp` and the password `12345`.
